218,,It was not pleasant at all. The auditors were not at all professional and their behavior was very bad. They have raised irrelevant and irrelevant NCs. Also even after our closing of NCS she took 10-12 days to close from her side. BETTER AUDITORS SHOULD BE SENT FOR AUDIT.

247, Assessors raised NC on portal about the things which was available in the lab. They should first discuss because the NC can not be reverted. Our assessors raised very weak NCs. Also there should be option to revert the NC by lead assessor.,Assessment process was good. There are two things about which our lab face problem a lot of times. First is NABL site is very slow and does not work at all many times. Second is NABL audit extension process should be fast as many times due to this our NABL accreditation process get delayed and we face monetory loss as our client ask for the certificate.
